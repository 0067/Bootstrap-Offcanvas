But works perfectly.\r\n\r\n![Screencap showing off-canvas menu](https://github.com/iamphill/Bootstrap-Offcanvas/blob/master/screencap.gif)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nAdd the stylehseet from the **dist** folder to your HTML document.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"../dist/css/bootstrap.offcanvas.min.css\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd the JavaScript from the **dist** folder to your HTML document.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: Ensure that jQuery is also present. Otherwise this won't work**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"../dist/js/bootstrap.offcanvas.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the HTML itself there needs to a button or something to trigger the menu.\r\n**NOTE: It can be ANY HTML element**\r\n\r\nThe below example is the exact same markup as from the Bootstrap docs. The only differences are the `data-toggle`, `data-target` attributes and `offcanvas-toggle` class.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<button type=\"button\" class=\"navbar-toggle offcanvas-toggle\" data-toggle=\"offcanvas\" data-target=\"#js-bootstrap-offcanvas\">\r\n    <span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span>\r\n    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, the nav HTML should be as follows. The only things needed are:\r\n\r\n- The class `navbar-offcanvas`\r\n- The selector that is specified in the `data-target` of the toggle. Example below uses an ID.\r\n**NOTE: This can also be any element as long as the classes and attributes are correct**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<nav class=\"navbar navbar-default navbar-offcanvas\" role=\"navigation\" id=\"js-bootstrap-offcanvas\">\r\n    ...\r\n</nav>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can change the position of the off-canvas nav by adding the following class\r\n\r\n```\r\nnavbar-offcanvas-right\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running example\r\n\r\nRun the below commands to install all dependencies and then just open the index.html file in example/\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Customizing\r\n\r\nIts possible to customize to your needs by using SASS.\r\n\r\nWant to include with your Bootstrap SASS? Copy across the files in src/sass.\r\n\r\nThe SASS files use a few variables. These are explained below.\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n$offcanvas-width: 250px !default; // The width of the offcanvas menu\r\n$offcanvas-animation-time: 0.15s !default; // Transition time to pull/hide menu\r\n$offcanvas-toggle-background: #f8f8f8 !default; // Background colour for toggle\r\n$offcanvas-toggle-bars-color: #000 !default; // Colour for icon bars in toggle\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is one media query and this uses the Bootstrap `$screen-sm` variable. If this isn't present, then the width of `768px` is used for the breakpoint.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Fade out content behind off canvas menu when pulled out\r\n- [ ] Different transitions and animations when pulling out and hiding\r\n- [ ] Swipe to pull menu out\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
